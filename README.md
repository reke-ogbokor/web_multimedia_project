For our team project, we will be making a Mario clone. We have found a game engine built on processing which we will be utilizing. Each team member will be making their own level, so  there should be four levels in total once this project is finished. Each level will have its own differences and each level will be unique in its own way.  The engine we are using already has free assets that we can use, so we don't need to hand-draw any assets or sprites. We are also using Git and Github for version control to connect our levels.
